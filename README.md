# Wordpress-comment-form
An add_filter function to style the comment form with Foundation 6.

## Getting Started
This is an add_filter function that allows you to style the comment form using the Foundation Framework. Markup allows styling of 
the input fields. The $fields array and the $defaults array can be edited in any way that you prefer. This allows you to take control of the styling of the default comment form.
